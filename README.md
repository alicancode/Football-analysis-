# Football-analysis-
This project was inspired by my love for football and is completely free to use. 

Due to the lack of GPU and training time, I could not train YOLO to track the ball properly
Hence while I intended it to have ball possession stats, i was unsable to do so as my nodel was giving a few false positives on ball object.

Nevertheless, I do intend to carry forward with the foul detection system. Which is based on completely different angles anyways, obviously not real time.
